Terry Porter found and ported a Forth register file generator for Mecrisp-Stellaris:

I came across a very interesting link that you may not have seen ?
https://github.com/ralfdoering/cmsis-svd-fth

Basically using this XML parser, one can instantly create *all* register constants and 
words for *any* ARM chip that cmsis-svd supports. 
No need to hack header files or spend weeks doing it by hand :)

The howto is in the link along with the URL and info on how to obtain the SCD files for many ARM chips.

The extract.xsl in the above release produces non Mecrisp compatible output, 
so I've modified it so it does. I have attached my file extract-mecrisp.xsl for your entertainment.

I have also attached the output from extract-mecrisp.xsl for a STM32F0xx mcu,
called STM32F0xx.fth which I have tested and seems to work fine. 


This is a small extract from the original README by Ralf DÃ¶ring:

It needs the following tools:
- xsltproc
- bash and sed to run the script

Usage:

0. chmod +x convert.sh

1. Download the SVD files for your target CPU. On place to find them is on the 
   [ARM Website](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php).
   This needs a simple registration.

2. Create the FORTH code for the register definitions by running 'convert.sh file.svd > file.fs'.

I converted the whole STM library with 'for i in *svd; do ./convert.sh $i > ${i%.svd}.fs; done'
As they are covered by a licence, I cannot include SVD files in this package.
