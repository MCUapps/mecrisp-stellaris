# This requires Super Sed (ssed).  Invoke with ssed -Rf ss <files>

# First let's get rid of lines that are bnegin with comments
/^\\[\t \n\r]/d

# Now, let's get rid of end-of-line comments.  This isn't perfect.  It will not remove a comment
# if there is a quote in it
s/[\t ]\\[\t ][^"]*$//

# This collapses all white spaces ... as long as they aren't between quotes
s/\s+(?=([^"]*"[^"]*")*[^"]*$)/ /g

# get rid of blank lines
/^\s*$/d 

# Note:  if a commented line also has quotes (either in the code or comment)
# this script just leaves the comment in.
