# forth-ft800   https://github.com/jamesbowman/forth-ft800

This is a Forth driver for the
[FTDI FT800](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT800.html) GPU, as
used in many devices, including the [Gameduino 2](http://gameduino.com).

It assumes a 32-bit ANS Forth plus a handful of other words for interfacing.

'gd2.fs' contains the bindings themselves.
There are notes at the beginning of the file on the required support words.
